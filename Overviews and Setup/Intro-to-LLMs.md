# What is an LLM

A type of AIprogram that can recognize and generate text, among other tasks. They are trained on large data sets.
They are build on machine learning: specifically a type of neural network called a transformer model.

GPT = Generative Pretrained Transformer

Use the dataset to calculate the most likely next word given the previous content or question posed. Basically, a very
sophisticated probability engine that can be used for:

* Completions
* Text Summarization
* Language Understanding
* Language Translation
* Analysis. Recommendations

## Foundational Model
LLM trained on a large amount of unlabeled data usimg a transformer algorithm, resulting in a model that can be adapted 
to a wide range of applications.

## LLM
LLM trained on a large amount of text to interpret and output human-like textual output.

## Generative AI
AI techniques that learn from a representation of artifacts from data and models which are used to generate new artifacts 
that relate to the originals.

## Fine Tuning
Taking a pre-trained or base model and executing additional training on a specific dataset
or domain. This involves adjusting model parameters based on the new dataset.

## Chatbot
Conversational apps built on top of an LLM. Key component is memory/context so each responses takes the previous input and 
response into account (within the limits of context - memory).

## Multi-modal
Able to operate on multiple datasets like text, video generation, visual recognition, voice recognition, etc.

# What is RAG - Retrieval Augmented Generation
Supplement the general dataset used by the LLM with proprietary or private data specific to your enterprise, org,
or processes. Leverages the predictive and analytic capabilities of the larger LLM to work on data specific to your org
that is not publicly available. Can semantically understand the local documents and respond with semantic articulation 
to user requests or questions.

* Customer service
* Specific technical analysis
* Company specific processes or rules
